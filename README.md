- aku set_-alias key value: this will just store the key value in a file

- aku set-alias some__complex_command {p1} some_things_else {p2}... | some_simple_command {val1}, {val2} : this will store the key with the place holders(which are {p1}, {p2}, etc) and value will be the command after the pipe(|), NOTE while setting up the alais, we don't need to put the values, but while using the alias we will need to input the values for the place holders
